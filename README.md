# LLM Repo Assistant

LLM Repo Assistant provides an API for a Language Model (LLM) to interact with
your code repository and dramatically increase your productivity as a developer.
The API enables an LLM to view the directory structure, read files, write files,
execute tests, get language-specific code summaries, and write language-specific
code.

It is designed to be usable as a ChatGPT plugin, allowing you do leverage the
power of ChatGPT to edit your repo from within ChatGPT and leverage its power.
