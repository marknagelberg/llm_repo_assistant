## Suggested Prompts for Testing Using LLM Repo Assistant

### Developing Tests

Develop a comprehensive set of tests for endpoints related to **Insert Functionality you want to Test**
code repo, which is a **insert high-level details about the repo**. The tests should be added to a
file within the **Give directory where tests should be stored** directory and should follow best practices
for writing programming tests.

The goal of this prompt is to ensure that the repo is
functioning properly and free from errors by creating a thorough suite
of tests for its file-related endpoints.

Think step by step about how you will complete this task. Run the steps by me
and prompt me for approval before you execute each subsequent step.


### Running Tests and Refactoring

I have developed a set of tests in my code repo which
**insert high-level details about the repo**.
The tests are located in the file **Insert File Path**.
Please run these tests and fix issues
that arise, which likely means a mistake in the code but also may be a mistake
in the test. Do this step by step and ask for my approval before proceeding
through each step.
